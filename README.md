# CNN-LTSM
A violence detection machine learning model built using CNN (convolutional neural networks) complemented with a Bidirectional  LSTM (long short term memory) cell.
The model was first built with plain CNN which was trained and tested using ice hockey dataset (CNNViolence)
A Bi directional LTSM was added to the CNN to see if there was any improvement in performance (BiLstm CNN)
To test the model the CNN BiLTSM was reevaluated using a new ice  hockey dataset created from ice hockey videos from the internet (ValidateLstm)
